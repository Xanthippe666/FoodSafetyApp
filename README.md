A single-page application (SPA) for a food inventory tracking application built using Vue.js and webpack. 

##To run
Three things are required to start the system:
1. mongo database has to start running. 
`mongod`
2. start the RESTful server-side by going into gshop-server and typing
`npm start` or `node server.js`
Dependencies may have to be installed first for the server to start correctly.
3. start the client-side either by typing `npm start` or by 'serving' the static files by first going into gshop-client then typing
`serve .\dist`
